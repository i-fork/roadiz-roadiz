Roadiz is a modern CMS based on a polymorphic content-schema system which can handle many types of services.
Its back-office has been developed with a high sense of design and user experience.
Roadiz theming system is built to live independently of back-office allowing easy switching
and multiple themes for one content repository.
Roadiz is released under *MIT license*, so you can reuse
and distribute its code for personal and commercial projects.
